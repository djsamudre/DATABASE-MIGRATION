# Database Migration Report

## 1. Overview
This report documents the migration of data from MySQL to PostgreSQL.  
The migration was completed using a SQL script that recreated the database, tables, and inserted the necessary records into PostgreSQL.

## 2. Steps Followed
1. Created a new database in PostgreSQL named `my_postgres_db`.
2. Created a `users` table with the same structure as in MySQL.
3. Inserted the required data into the `users` table.
4. Verified that the data was successfully inserted.

## 3. SQL Script Used
The following SQL script was executed to complete the migration:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_postgres_db;
\c my_postgres_db;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES
('Alice Johnson', 'alice@example.com'),
('Bob Smith', 'bob@example.com'),
('Charlie Brown', 'charlie@example.com');

SELECT * FROM users;
