*DESCRIPTION OF TASK*:

1. Introduction
Database migration is the process of transferring data between different database management systems (DBMS). This task specifically involves migrating data from MySQL to PostgreSQL, ensuring that all records, table structures, and constraints remain intact during the process.

MySQL and PostgreSQL are both widely used relational database management systems, but they have differences in syntax, indexing, and data types. Therefore, a structured approach is required to successfully migrate data while maintaining its accuracy and integrity.

This report provides a theoretical explanation of the migration process, outlining the steps taken, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented.

2. Objective of the Migration
The primary goal of this migration task is to:
✔️ Transfer data from MySQL to PostgreSQL efficiently.
✔️ Ensure database structures and constraints remain consistent.
✔️ Prevent any data loss or corruption during the transition.
✔️ Automate the migration using SQL scripts for accuracy.

Since the database migration process involves two different database systems, it requires careful consideration of compatibility issues and differences in syntax between MySQL and PostgreSQL.

3. Steps Involved in Database Migration
Step 1: Understanding the Source Database (MySQL)
Before initiating the migration, it was essential to analyze the MySQL database. This involved identifying:

The database name
Table structures (columns, data types, primary keys, and unique constraints)
Existing data entries that need to be transferred
A backup of the MySQL database was created to prevent any accidental data loss during the migration process.

Step 2: Setting Up the Target Database (PostgreSQL)
A corresponding PostgreSQL database was created to hold the migrated data. Since PostgreSQL follows a different syntax for certain data types and constraints, the table structures had to be adjusted accordingly.

For example, MySQL uses AUTO_INCREMENT for primary keys, whereas PostgreSQL uses SERIAL for the same functionality.

Step 3: Transferring the Data
After defining the database and tables in PostgreSQL, the next step was to migrate the actual records from MySQL. The data was extracted from MySQL and inserted into PostgreSQL while ensuring that:

The data types remained compatible
No constraints (such as unique or primary keys) were violated
The sequence of records was preserved
Step 4: Verifying Data Integrity
Once the data was successfully inserted into PostgreSQL, verification steps were performed to confirm the accuracy of the migration. This included:

Checking if all expected records were present in PostgreSQL
Validating that constraints (such as unique email addresses) were enforced correctly
Running queries to ensure data consistency
4. Challenges Faced and Their Solutions
1️⃣ Differences in Data Types and Constraints

MySQL and PostgreSQL have different ways of handling auto-incrementing primary keys and character encoding.
Solution: Used PostgreSQL-compatible data types and constraints.
2️⃣ SQL Syntax Differences

Certain MySQL-specific SQL commands are not directly compatible with PostgreSQL.
Solution: Adjusted table creation and insert statements accordingly.
3️⃣ Permission Issues

PostgreSQL sometimes restricts access to certain directories when executing scripts.
Solution: Ensured that SQL files were stored in an accessible directory before execution.
4️⃣ Verifying Data Accuracy

After migration, there was a need to confirm that all records were transferred correctly.
Solution: Performed test queries and compared results with the original MySQL data.
5. Conclusion
The migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL was successfully completed while preserving the original data structure and constraints. By following a structured approach, potential challenges such as data type mismatches and syntax differences were effectively managed.

Post-migration verification confirmed that all records were correctly transferred, ensuring that the PostgreSQL database mirrored the original MySQL database accurately.
